# real-time-chat
A real time chat application written in Go backend with Angular front end using basic web sockets

Code from <a href="https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/12/create-real-time-chat-app-golang-angular-2-websockets/">here</a>
Credits: Nic Raboy

To run:

Terminal 1
------------
go run main.go

Terminal 2
------------
ng serve

(Might need to do some installation with <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Angular CLI</a>)

Navigate to localhost:4200 on multiple tabs to chat.

I plan to add better design and more features as I get time.
